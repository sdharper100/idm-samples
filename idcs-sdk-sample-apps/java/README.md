# Oracle Identity Cloud Service' SDK Java Sample Application

Oracle Identity Cloud Service provides a Software Development Kit (SDK) that you can use to integrate Java web applications with Oracle Identity Cloud Service.

The Java SDK is available as a Java Archive (JAR) (idcs-assert.jar) file, which must be loaded as a web application library.

This Sample Code is used in the following tutorial: [Use Oracle Identity Cloud Service's SDK for Authentication in Java Web Applications]( https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:112:0::::P112_CONTENT_ID:22663)

**Important:** The sample web application isn't meant to be published to production and isn't concerned about the languageâ€™s specific best practices, such as data handling, patterns, security, and so on. The sole purpose of the sample web application is to address the recommended approach to integrate Oracle Identity Cloud Service and a custom application using the SDK.

## Dependent Third-party libraries
The Oracle Identity Cloud Service SDK for Java is depedent of the following libraries and version:
- [ASM Helper Minidev 1.0.2](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.minidev/asm)
- [Apache Commons Collections 4.1](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.commons/commons-collections4)
- [Apache Commons Lang 3.6](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.commons/commons-lang3)
- [JSON Small And Fast Parser 2.3](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.minidev/json-smart)
- [Nimbus LangTag 1.4.3](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.nimbusds/lang-tag)
- [Nimbus JOSE+JWT 4.39.1](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.nimbusds/nimbus-jose-jwt)
- [OAuth 2.0 SDK With OpenID Connect Extensions 5.30](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.nimbusds/oauth2-oidc-sdk)

**Note:** Before deploying or using this sample application, it need to be updated following the instruction below:

## How to use the Sample Application:

The sample web application needs an application's Client ID and Secret to establish communication with Oracle Identity Cloud Service.  Follow the referenced tutorial to register an application.

Access the Oracle Identity Cloud Service console and download the SDK for Java. Inside the downloaded zip file there is a file called **idcs-asserter.jar**. The name of the java sdk jar file may vary. Copy the file to the location pointed in the pom.xml file below.

Access the Oracle Identity Cloud Service console, and add a trusted application with the following information:
- Populate the Details pane as follows, and then click Next.
    Name: SDK Web Application
    Description: SDK Web Application

- In the Client pane, select Configure this application as a client now, and then populate the fields of this pane, as follows:
    Allowed Grant Types: Select **Authorization Code**.
    Allow non-HTTPS URLs: Select this check box. The sample application works in non-HTTPS mode.
    Redirect URL: http://localhost:8080/callback
    Logout URL: http://localhost:8080/logout
    Post Logout Redirect URL: http://localhost:8080

- In the Client pane, scroll down, select Grant the client access to Identity Cloud Service Admin APIs., enter **Me**.  
- Finish, make a note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values, and activate the application.

Edit the **pom.xml** file, update the JAR file name in the following statement, and then save the file.
```xml
<!-- Add here the Oracle Identity Cloud Service SDK dependency entry -->
        <dependency>
                <groupId>oracle.security.jps.idcsbinding</groupId>
                <artifactId>sdk</artifactId>
                <version>1.0</version>
                <scope>system</scope>
                <systemPath>${basedir}/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/idcs-asserter.jar</systemPath>
        </dependency>
```
**Note:** make sure the name of the idcs-asserter.jar file matches the name of the java SDK jar file downloaded from the Oracle Identity Cloud Service console.

Edit the **ConnectionOptions.java** file and update the IDCS_HOST, IDCS_PORT, IDCS_CLIENT_ID, IDCS_CLIENT_SECRET,  IDCS_CLIENT_TENANT and AUDIENCE_SERVICE_URL variables.
```java
public Map<String,Object> getOptions(){
        this.options.put(IDCSTokenAssertionConfiguration.IDCS_HOST, "identity.oraclecloud.com");
        this.options.put(IDCSTokenAssertionConfiguration.IDCS_PORT, "443");
        this.options.put(IDCSTokenAssertionConfiguration.IDCS_CLIENT_ID, "123456789abcdefghij");
        this.options.put(IDCSTokenAssertionConfiguration.IDCS_CLIENT_SECRET, "abcde-12345-zyxvu-98765-qwerty");
        this.options.put(IDCSTokenAssertionConfiguration.IDCS_CLIENT_TENANT, "idcs-abcd1234");
        this.options.put(Constants.AUDIENCE_SERVICE_URL, "https://idcs-abcd1234.identity.oraclecloud.com");
        this.options.put(Constants.TOKEN_ISSUER, "https://identity.oraclecloud.com");
        this.options.put(Constants.TOKEN_CLAIM_SCOPE, "urn:opc:idm:t.user.me openid");
        this.options.put("SSLEnabled", "true");
        this.options.put("redirectURL", "http://localhost:8080/callback");
        this.options.put("logoutSufix", "/sso/v1/user/logout");
	return this.options;
}
```

Below is a brief explanation  for each of the required attributes for the SDK:
- **IDCSTokenAssertionConfiguration.IDCS_HOST**: The Oracle Identity Cloud Service instance domain sufix.
- **IDCSTokenAssertionConfiguration.IDCS_PORT**: The Oracle Identity Cloud Service instance HTTPS port. Usually 443.
- **IDCSTokenAssertionConfiguration.IDCS_CLIENT_ID**: Client ID value generated after you register the web application in Oracle Identity Cloud Service console.
- **IDCSTokenAssertionConfiguration.IDCS_CLIENT_SECRET**: Client Secret value generated after you register the web application in Oracle Identity Cloud Service console.
- **IDCSTokenAssertionConfiguration.IDCS_TENANT**: The domain prefix of you Oracle Identity Cloud Service instance. Usually a value similar to the example above.
- **Constants.AUDIENCE_SERVICE_URL**: The full qualified domain name URL of your Oracle Identity Cloud Service instance.
- **Constants.TOKEN_ISSUER**: Oracle recomends to keep the value as presented here.
- **Constants.TOKEN_CLAIM_SCOPE**: Scope contols what data the application can access/process on behalf of the user. Since the application uses the SDK for authentication purpose the scope is openid. The application also implements the get user's details use case. In this case you need to also use the scope urn:opc:idm:t.user.me.
- **SSLEnabled**: Indicates wether he Oracle Identity Cloud Service responds HTTPs or HTTP requests. Oracle recomends to keep the value as presented here.

The **logoutSufix** and **redirectURL** are both used by the application, hence they are not required by the SDK.

The **AuthSevlet.java** file  class maps to the **/auth** URL. It uses the SDK to generate the authorization code URL, and redirects the browser to the generated URL.
Four important parameters are used to generate the authorization code URL:
- **redirectUrl**: After successfull sign in, Oracle Identity Cloud Service redirects the user browser to this URL. This URL must match the one configured in the trusted application in Oracle Identity Cloud Service console.
- **scope**: The OAuth/OpenID Connect scope of authentication. This application requires only openid authentication to be handled by Oracle Identity Cloud Service.
- **1234**: The state value is meant to be a code that the sample web application might use to check if the communication was made correctly to Oracle Identity Cloud Service. The state parameter is defined by the OAuth protocol.
- **code**: Value required by the authorization code grant type.

Tthe **CallbackServlet.java** class maps to the **/callback** URL, and uses the authorization code parameter to request an access token. The access token is then stored in the user session, along with the userId and displayName values. Then, the servlet forwards the request to the **private/home.jsp** page.

The **/private/myProfile.jsp** page accesses the user's access token previously set in the session, calls the getAuthenticatedUser method to retrieve the user's information, and then formats it as HTML.

The **LogoutServlet.java** class invalidates the user session and then redirects the user to Oracle Identity Cloud Service's log out URL.

## Run the Sample Web Application

- Open the java project in [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/). Make sure to use [Java SDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). 

- Build and Run the application.
 
- Open a browser window, access the http://localhost:8080 URL, click **Log in**, and then click the Oracle red icon.

- The Oracle Identity Cloud Service Sign In page appears.
